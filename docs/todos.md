## Issues/To Dos
- Airmap layers
    - Airmap doesn't support the new satellite mapbox layer
    - If map starts on or is switched to the satellite mapbox layer, the airmap layers will not show
- Map regions/routes/missions
    - Allow selection of multiple routes for a drone
    - Add properties to routes and regions when selecting them for a drone
        - For example: Searching route/region or flying only route/region
    - Choose/notify which part of region a drone gets
        - Currently, drones are given their starting locations on a shared region based on what gives the minimum overall distance to fly between all selected drones
        - Still need to check for intersections
            - There is logic for checking intersections that has not yet been fully implemented and tested: https://github.com/DroneResponse/DR-GUI/blob/master/src/app/map-layers/RegionPath.ts#L285
- Video streaming
    - Live video from UDP stream with H.264
        - Likely best option is to use WebRTC using a media server like [Kurento](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [OpenVidu](https://openvidu.io/)
- Drone Connections Page
    - Page is functional but needs to be updated to include all of the information from the [Drone](https://github.com/DroneResponse/DR-GUI/blob/master/src/app/model/Drone.ts) model
- Mission JSONs
    - Display more missions than just waypoints
        - Show hovers and circling of targets
    - Allow selecting of multiple missions in the mission wizard
        - Currently, the mission wizard only allows for selecting a single saved mission that supports the number of drones selected for that role
    - Allow for uploading multiple JSON files to be saved as a singular mission
- Speed not showing up properly from drones
    - Airspeed is not being updated on onboard pilot
- Altitude relative to drone's home position
    - This is currently supported in production mode if an Open Topo Data API is running locally (see [README](https://github.com/DroneResponse/DR-GUI#open-topo-data-altitude-api-installation))
- MissionStatusComponent
    - See if this component is still needed and what work needs to be done to get it working if it is wanted
- When creating missions with hover points, look at the old [MissionMapComponent](https://github.com/DroneResponse/DR-GUI/blob/edf50bd96c12b02c35eb09a62083a67b371f41db/src/app/mission-map/mission-map.component.ts#L135) code
